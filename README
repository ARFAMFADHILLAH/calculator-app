Project calculator
A calculator app is a digital tool that allows users to perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It typically consists of:

Display Screen: This shows the numbers you enter and the results of your calculations. Buttons: These include number buttons (0â€“9), math operators (+, -, *, /), and special buttons like equals (=) and clear (C). Functionality: When a button is pressed, JavaScript functions process the input, perform the calculations, and update the display. The app uses HTML to create the structure, CSS to style the appearance, and JavaScript to handle the logic and calculations. It's designed to be simple and user-friendly, with a responsive layout that works on different screen sizes.
